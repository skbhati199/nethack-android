This directory contains the files necessary to build an Android application
package containing additional tilesets for the Android port of NetHack Slash'EM
(nethack-android, com.slashemff). By making it a separate package, the size
of the core application can be kept down for players that are low on space,
or otherwise don't care for tiles beyond the standard set.

The tilesets included here were made by other people, and have been made
freely available online for use by the NetHack community. If you are the
creator of one of these and wish for me to remove it from the distribution,
or want to be credited differently, please contact me.

Abigaba 24x24
-------------

This tileset is included by permission from its creator, Chozo Abigaba. For
more info and download, see
  http://www.multifoliate.com/nh/.

Additional tilesets may be added in future versions. If you have any other
quality tileset that you want to be included in this application (or as a
separate package), please let me know.

To build the package, if you have the Android SDK and Eclipse installed
in a Linux environment, simply open Eclipse and use the option to create
a new Android application from existing source, and export it as an .apk.
